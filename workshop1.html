								<h2>Rationale</h2>
							</header>
                            <p>Pornography may be difficult to talk about, but it’s also very easy to access in almost infinite quantities. By the age of 16 over 90% of boys and 60% of girls in Australia have been exposed to pornography (Flemming et al 2006), and studies suggest the average age of first exposure to online pornography is 11 years old.

                            <br>
                            
							 <p>Mainstream music videos, films, and advertising have also become ‘pornified’, setting a new norm for sexuality.The myths espoused by porn are incredibly damaging to development and relationships, and have been linked with broader issues of mental ill-health and sexual assault.</p>

								<h2>Content</h2>
                                <p>This workshop is designed to correct the myths created by porn in three key areas – body image, gender roles, and ‘sexpectations’ – and to discuss the growing issue of porn addiction.</p>
							</header>
                            <p>






Gender roles
Most mainstream pornography is made for a ‘(heterosexual) male gaze’, and presents incredibly toxic ideas of gender relations. Women are treated as passive objects existing only for male pleasure, whereas men are expected to fill a highly aggressive role of dominance. Using music videos as a substitute, this section discusses the damaging effect of such expectations for all genders, as well as ways of challenging them. 

Sexpectations
Much like learning to drive from the Fast and Furious franchise, porn creates an inaccurate Hollywood-ised set of expectations around sex – or ‘sexpectations’. Studies are worryingly showing that young people are increasingly expecting their partners to play out the scenes they’re watching online, including the violence (both physical and verbal), high prevalence of anal sex, and the lack of protection or consent. Through ’10 myths’, this section challenges the normalisation of these practises and underscores the importance of consent in relationships.

Porn addiction
Online pornography is a super-natural stimulant, and there is an increasing number of young people (including women) who have so strongly wired their pleasure neurons with pornography that they develop addiction symptoms. Included in this is the tendency towards ‘escalation’ into more shocking pornography genres, and an inability to enjoy real sex. This section of the workshop delves into the brain science behind it all and practical things young people can do to avoid those pitfalls.

Debrief
The debrief includes a summary, reflection, and opportunity for questions. It is also a time to point out a list of available resources and reemphasise the importance of continuing the conversations outside the workshop. A feedback survey is also distributed in this time.

							<h3>Introduction</h3>
                            <p>Designed to create a safe and open space for discussion, the introductory ice breakers are all about shattering the taboos around pornography and sex</p>
                            <h3>Body Image</h3>
                            <p>The pressures on young people to look a certain way has never been this intense, and it’s no wonder when the bodies they are exposed to are so unrealistic. Although other aspects are commonly discussed, it is lesser known that almost one in two men are concerned by the size of their penises (Wylie and Eardly 2007) nor that the fastest growing cosmetic surgery in Australia is labia plasticity (plastic surgery on the labia to fit the ‘pornstar vagina’ look). In line with research, this section tackles body-image issues through education, by providing averages and discussions about the effect of porn on body image.</p>
