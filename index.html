								<h2>What is 2 Birds 1 Bee?!</h2>
							</header>
                            <p>2 Birds 1 Bee is a youth-run educational project that engages with young people in areas of sexuality and relationships. It brings often taboo conversations to the table and provides the skills and awareness to challenge the taboos and inspire empathy.</p>

					<h2>Goal and Philosophy</h2>
					</header>
					<p>'2 Birds 1 Bee' is a play on both the 'birds and bees' and 'hitting two birds with one stone' metaphors. Through the singular 'stone' (bee?) of workshops, we not only provide educational content but also spark conversations, dealing with issues and taking the sting out of taboos in one swoop!
						2B1B takes on topics that aren't covered in curricula and usually aren't talked about at all. The workshop topics reflect the modern world, with all its new challenges and advantages.
						Most institutions' knee-jerk reaction to any conversation involving sex and young people is to shut it down and limit as much information as possible for as long as possible. 2 Birds 1 Bee is not like most institutions. Following on from the fundamental belief in the capabilities of young people, this organisation is all about:
					

					<ul>
									<li>Equipping young people with skills and information</li>
									<li>Engaging them to think critically and empathetically</li>
									<li>Starting conversations</li>
								</ul>

							<h3>XXXposed - Bringing Porn Out From Beneath the Covers</h3>
                            <h4>Target: Years 8-12</h4>
							<p>This workshop is designed to correct the myths created by porn in three key areas – body image, gender roles, and ‘sexpectations’ – and to discuss the growing issue of porn addiction.</p>

							<h3>LGBTQIA...WTF? - Gender and Sexuality Diversity</h3>
                            <h4>Target: Years 8-12</h4>
							<p>What do those letters actually mean? And more importantly – who are the people behind them? This workshop provides a small overview of different gender and sexuality identifications, highlighting statistics and the big issues facing each group. It finishes with the vital discussion of why such labels can be so important to those who identify with them, and what can be done to support them.</p>
